    <h1>EARBUDS</h1>
    
    In level two, our class had an assignment by professor john to design earbuds, and then framing out advertising posters along with rendering a video commercial. The agenda was to familiarize us with the 3d software and modelling. 
    We learnt about setting up lights, camera angles, setting keyframes, rendering out the videos and photos. 
    The experience was really good, however, new things always come up with tricky problems and push us to get over them.</div>

 <h1>Case Study</h1>

  <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
  <p>As i was not familiar with the 3d software and 3d modelling, i came across many challenges even after getting lessons from professor . Common problems like centralizing the axis of 3d elements and then setting up camera arose but could be solved after asking prof. However, modelling 3d shapes as per design was the most difficult part as it requires hands on experience and knowledge of all the  tools of the specific software. After that, setting up keyframes to make the desired animation was another problem as i could not make the camera movement and product (earbud) movement smooth and slow. So, these wee the main problems that i faced in the very beginning </p>
